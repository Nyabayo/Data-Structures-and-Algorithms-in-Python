#Introduction To Data Structures and Algorithms
#Built in Data Structures: lists,tuples,sets, dictionaries, etc.
#User Defined Data Structures: linked trees, lists, and graphs
#Algorithms
#DATA STRUCTURES: Is about how data can be stored in different structures.
#Algorithm: is a set of step by step solution to solve a problem
#Algorithms: Is about how to solve different problems often by searching through and manipulating data structures
#ALGORITHMS: Is a step by step solution to solve a problem, often by searching through and manipulating data structures
#Data structures and algorithms (DSA): Helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems effeciently.
#DATA STRUCTURES: Is a way to store data.
#Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
#Types of Data structures: Primitive and Abstract Data Structures.
# 1. Primitive Data Structures: are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, etc.
# 2. Abstract Data Structures: are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations.
#Examples of abstract data types: arrats, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
#ALGORITHMS
#An algorithm is a set of step by step instructions to solve a problem or achieve a specific goal, often through searching and manipulating Data Structures.
